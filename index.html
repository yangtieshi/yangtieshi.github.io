<p>📧 When I applied to Lingnan University to enter Hong Kong, I found that the local culture here is very distinctive and deeply attracted me, and I hope to make more friends in Hong Kong
  
<p>📝 I'm usually an i person, but after I get acquainted with my friends, I become super e, as the saying goes, e people enjoy the world first, and we can find our own different life in Lingnan
